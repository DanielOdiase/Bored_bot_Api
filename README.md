# Bored_bot_Api
 Purpose of this bot is to suggest options when you are bored. 
This is my first hand experience with Web API's 
Methods/tools to be utilized include : 

fetch() with Json 
this basically interacts or fetched the required information from the api (Server)and 
uses it in the code
getElementById()will be used to initialize the buttons as well as display texts . 
Other Javascript ,Html and CSS Properties will be used for entire Project
